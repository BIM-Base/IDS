 * XML (and XML Facets) seem the best choice as a technology for a first version.
 * Although there is a desire to reuse existing technologies (RuleML, Schematron, etc) vendors have declared they will not use toolkits and implement themselves. 
 * It is a desire to create an IDS language/schema that can be used independent of the IFC versions. Actual IDS files (use-cases) will/might still be specific for IFC versions. Therefore an 'IFC Lite' representation is created from IFC data to which the IDS is compared. This 'lite' representation has direct links between classification references, material, properties and the objects.

 * Schematron
 * XSLT
